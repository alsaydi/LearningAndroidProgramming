# Learning Android Programming

A collection of projects where I learn android programming concepts.
In addition to the official docs https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview, I am reading this book https://www.packtpub.com/product/android-sensor-programming-by-example/9781785285509

I am not an expert, so dont' just copy and paste code from here.
